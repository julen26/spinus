Spinus
====
**Spinus** is a 2D game development framework for web platforms that includes necessary tools for programmers. It's written in _JavaScript_ and it uses WebGL features to communicate with the _GPU_. Although JavaScript is a loosely typed language, this framework uses the **Object Oriented Programming** paradigms. Its modules offer high level specific functionality and prevents the developer from fighting with low level programming models.
